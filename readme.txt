Your tool should do the following:

* Take in the user's first and last name and only allow program access if the user is an authorized user. Assume a user is authorized if they have the property role of "Admin". Don't worry about writing additional logic to authorize the user.
* Allow an authorized user to input a unit number and retrieve a list of all residents of that unit.
* Allow a user to input a first name and last name and retrieve any information we have about a resident whose name matches that first and last name. That information should include the user's unit, their role(s) on the property, and any devices that the user can control
* Write a function that will allow the user to move in a new resident or move out an old resident. (Don't change the data in property_data.json. Instead copy the new state of the data into a file named `property_data_changes.json`.)

Try to anticipate the user's needs and create an interface that meets them.

## About the data

Sample data are in the file `property_data.json`.
The "roles" key on people objects refers to the roles a user has on that property, which impacts what devices they can control.

A person may control a device if:

* It is associated with their unit of residence.
* The device is marked as admin_accessible and the user is an admin.
  * For example, Mackenzie Carroll can control the thermostat, lights, and lock that have a unit value that matches her residence, 102. Zakiyya Shabazz can control any device that has a unit value of 201, plus any "Sunnee" light and any lock (because she is an admin and those devices all have admin_accessible marked as true.)
